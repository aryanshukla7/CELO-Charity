    2) The values of amounts are in CELO.
    3) This is a developing project, so expect a lot of changes in the coming time. Right now it is only in its initial stages. We will be adding capabilities to upload pictures or videos to the description section to make your proposal more appealing to the masses, Along with that we are also in the process of adding authentication capability to check the legitimacy of proposals being created for fundraising. Along with that, we are constantly trying to bring changes to the application to better facilitate the user experience.
